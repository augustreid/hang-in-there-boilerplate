# 2108 Paired Project "Hang in There"

## Abstract
This project implements functionality for pre-existing HTML and CSS files.
The website randomly generates motivational posters using an image, a title,
and a quote. It also allows the user to create their own poster using an image
URL and user generated text. Both the randomized posters and user generated
posters can be saved to a gallery, and can be deleted from that gallery.
